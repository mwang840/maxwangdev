            I have been insterested in and have started playing chess since
            elementary school.I have participated in chess clubs throughout the
            school year (grade school and college) and I am open to new chess
            strategies. I also have a chess.com account if anyone likes to
            follow me and play me in chess (see contact page)â™”.

            At grade school, I was on the mens varsity soccer team and played
            soccer as a forward. After soccer, I have grown into weightlifting
            and started going to the gym to improve my strength to become
            stronger everyday.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently during school and during this summer, I&apos;ve started to
            improve my strength training by going to the gym to build up
            strength and eventually muscle.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first experience in hiking was when my family first traveled to
            the Grand Canyon and hiked on the trails.
          </p>

          <p>
            I eventually started to enjoy hiking later and occasionally go out
            with friends or family to hike in different places!

            A hobby that I enjoyed, I like to go see places around the world. As
            a young child, my family will take me to Taiwan to visit family.
            From that moment, I&apos;ve started appreicating where I go to
            capture the memories I make when traveling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Countries that I have been to are
            <li>Taiwan</li>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>South Korea</li>
            <li>Hong Kong</li>
            <li>Canada</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m hoping I can go visit Europe, Africa, Latin America and the
            rest of the United States

            Similar to traveling, but I&apos;ve enjoyed planes ever since my
            parents took me to Taiwan to visit family. I like passanger planes
            and my favorite is the Boeing 777. I&aposve yet to fly the airbus
            A-380!

            I hope to get more exposure to different airlines as I travel around
            the world and get to have a good time on those airlines
