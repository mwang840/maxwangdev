                        I have been insterested in and have started playing
                        chess since elementary school.I have participated in
                        chess clubs throughout the school year (grade school and
                        college) and I am open to new chess strategies. I also
                        have a chess.com account if anyone likes to follow me
                        and play me in chess (see contact page)â™”.

                        At grade school, I was on the mens varsity soccer team
                        and played soccer as a forward. After soccer, I have
                        grown into weightlifting and started going to the gym to
                        improve my strength to become stronger everyday.

                        Currently during school and during this summer,
                        I&apos;ve started to improve my strength training by
                        going to the gym to build up strength and eventually
                        muscle.

                    <p>
                        My first experience in hiking was when my family first
                        traveled to the Grand Canyon and hiked on the trails.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I eventually started to enjoy hiking later and
                        occasionally go out with friends or family to hike in
                        different places!

                        A hobby that I enjoyed, I like to go see places around
                        the world. As a young child, my family will take me to
                        Taiwan to visit family. From that moment, I&apos;ve
                        started appreicating where I go to capture the memories
                        I make when traveling.

                    <p>
                        Countries that I have been to are

                        <li>Japan</li>

                        I&apos;m hoping I can go visit Europe, Africa, Latin
                        America and the rest of the United States

                        Similar to traveling, but I&apos;ve enjoyed planes ever
                        since my parents took me to Taiwan to visit family. I
                        like passanger planes and my favorite is the Boeing 777.
                        I&apos;ve yet to fly the airbus A-380!

                        I hope to get more exposure to different airlines as I
                        travel around the world and get to have a good time on
                        those airlines

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I started my passion for computer science since high school. I
                always wanted to learn and understand how computers work and how
                programs are made.
                <br />
                <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting exposure to the
                STEM field utilized my anayltical and problem solving
                strategies. Further the classes that I&apos;ve taken (math and
                computer science) taught me how to approach challenges and
                &nbsp;problems with thinking, creativity and precision.
                <br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken a strong interest in
                math (although not picking up a major or a minor in the subject)
                and computer science. In the Computer Science field, I have
                taken a strong interest towards web development (front-end and
                back-end) and how to utilize a tech stack,the theory of
                &nbsp;&nbsp;computation (algorithm analysis), artificial
                intelligence and machine learning and data science. In math, I
                have a strong passion for calculus, linear algebra and discrete
                mathmatics
                <br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By opening myself up to those
                experiences, I have learned a lot of knowledge from those
                displicines and further strenghen my skills in those area.
